The XPM images for grub's background must be 14 color indexed images.

Use GIMP to edit the current background file (e.g., express_boot-3.2.xcf):
  - remove the transparency channel
  - change the image's mode to 'indexed', and choose '14' levels
  - hide the 'protect' layer and merge other layers down
  - export as xpm, save as express_boot_install.xpm
  - undo all changes in gimp
  - hide the 'install' layer and merge other layers down
  - export as xpm, save as express_boot_protect.xpm
  - undo all changes in gimp
  - exit gimp
  - gzip express_boot_install.xpm and express_boot_protect.xpm

The two images should be ready for grub to use.


Use inkscape to edit smoothwall-express-logos-3.2.svg. This file contains
the vector images for the 'new' Smoothwall Express logos. The 'smoothwall'
and the 'express' don't exactly match those that Smoothie Towers produced
(the fonts are slightly different), but I think they're close enough.

In time, the other logos used in Express will be added to the .svg file.
